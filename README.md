# Security of Microservices Deployed in Cloud Containers

This repository contains the code and resources for assessing and enhancing the security of microservices deployed in cloud containers using Docker and Kubernetes. The project aims to identify vulnerabilities, implement mitigation strategies, and ensure the security of containerized applications using automation tools and Bash scripts.

## Project Overview

In this project, we:
- Identify container-specific vulnerabilities affecting microservices deployments.
- Utilize security assessment tools such as Aqua Trivy, Docker Bench for Security, and Kube Bench.
- Automate security scans using Bash scripts.
- Implement secure deployment strategies for Kubernetes clusters.
- Validate the effectiveness of security solutions through extensive testing.

## System Design and Architecture

The system follows a layered architecture to ensure robust security at different levels of the containerized environment. Key components include:

### System Components and Tools
- **Bash Scripting**: Used for automating security scans, vulnerability assessments, and configuration checks.
- **Docker for Containerization**: Provides an isolated environment for microservices deployment.
- **Kubernetes for Orchestration**: Manages containerized microservices at scale.
- **Aqua Trivy**: Scans Docker images for vulnerabilities before deployment.
- **Docker Bench for Security**: Evaluates Docker security configurations.
- **Kube Bench**: Assesses Kubernetes cluster security based on CIS benchmarks.

## Steps Performed

### Environment Setup
- Install and configure Docker and Kubernetes.
- Set up a Kubernetes cluster on a Linux-based virtual machine.
- Deploy containerized applications with known vulnerabilities for security assessment.

### Security Assessment and Testing
- **Static Vulnerability Analysis**: Scan Docker images using Trivy before deployment.
- **Runtime Security Checks**: Monitor running containers for misconfigurations.
- **Kubernetes Security Audits**: Analyze cluster configurations using Kube Bench.

## Evaluation and Results
- The security scripts successfully detected vulnerabilities in Docker images and Kubernetes clusters.
- Implementing mitigation strategies (e.g., updating dependencies, applying security policies) significantly reduced security risks.
- Future improvements include integrating Machine Learning (ML) for real-time anomaly detection.

## Requirements

- **Operating System**: Linux-based environment (tested on CentOS and Rocky Linux)
- **Software & Tools**:
  - Docker 27.0.3+
  - Kubernetes 30.2+
  - Bash scripting
  - Aqua Trivy
  - Docker Bench for Security
  - Kube Bench

## Future Work
- Implement ML-based threat detection for real-time vulnerability assessment.
- Expand compatibility across multiple operating systems, including Windows and macOS.
- Improve scalability for enterprise-level security auditing.
